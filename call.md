We are excited to invite you to the highly interactive WOLVERINE 2022: “Workshop on Open Problems in Learning and Verification of Neural Networks”, which will be held on Thursday, August 11, during [FLoC 2022](https://www.floc2022.org/){:target="_blank"}.

The goal of WOLVERINE is to foster networking and active discussions with a hope to spark new interdisciplinary collaborations. WOLVERINE welcomes researchers in formal methods, machine learning, and their intersection. 


### <span style="color:#b11170">Workshop Schedule</span>
<span style="color:#b11170">**First hour: keynote talk**</span> by [Ann Nowé](https://ai.vub.ac.be/team/ann-nowe/){:target="_blank"} ([abstract](keynote)).\
<span style="color:#b11170">**Second hour: short invited talks.**</span> We will host three short invited talks (15-20 minutes each). Each speaker will present their area of expertise in the intersection between formal methods and AI.\
